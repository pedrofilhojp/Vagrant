## Main commands line that i use

- **vagrant init**: Creating initial Vagrantfile. If you dont know how to start, you can execute this command. But don't worry, we will use the "Vagrantfile" file shared in this repository for all our classes.
  
- **vagrant box list**: Show the boxes dowloaded in you system

The commands below, will read the configurations inside the Vagrantfile, therefore, need to execute in same path.
- **vagrant up**: Will **start** or **create** the virtual machines
- **vagrant ssh [virtual machine name]**: Normally, all box is builded with ssh key-pairs. After start the VM based in any box, with this command, you can access the VM using private ssh key that is store in .vagrant directory in same path of Vagrantfile.
- **vagrant halt**: Stop all VM inside the Vagrantfile
- **vagrant status**: Verify status of all VMs
- **vagrant reload**: Restart the VMs
- **vagrant destroy**: Stop and delete all VMs
